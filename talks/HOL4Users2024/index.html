      <h2>How Ethereum works</h2>
      <p class=callout>
      Ethereum is a shared decentralised computer.<br>
      There is global <span class=highlight>consensus on the state</span> of the machine.<br>
      <span class=highlight>State updates</span> obey deterministic rules, driven by user txns.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          The state is organised into <span class=highlight>accounts</span>, containing:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <ul>
            <li>a 20 byte address</li>
            <li>an ether balance</li>
            <li>storage: a map from <span class=code>bytes32</span> to <span class=code>bytes32</span></li>
            <li>(optionally) code: a sequence of bytes</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>Externally-owned account (EOA)</dt><dd>has private key associated with address, but no code</dd>
        <dt>Smart contract account</dt><dd>has code, but no private key</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>How Ethereum works: message calls</h2>
      <p class=callout>
      An account can be <span class=highlight>called</span> by another account.<br>
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Calls, used for both transfers and compute, contain:</dt>
        <dd>
          <ul>
            <li>sender address</li>
            <li>target address</li>
            <li>(optional) ether value to transfer</li>
            <li>(optional) data</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>The target's code is executed with the call data as input</dt>
        <dd>
          <ul>
            <li>execution context for stack-based <span class=highlight>virtual machine</span> with RAM</li>
            <li>may spawn <span class=italic>internal</span> calls (new contexts), which return data</li>
            <li>transactional: all or none of the storage and balance updates persist</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>A <span class=highlight>transaction</span> (txn) from an EOA is a call</dt>
        <dd>transaction info, including fee limit, signed with the private key; fees (gas) are charged for execution and deducted from the sender account</dd>
        <dt>Static calls (no state changes), aka <span class=highlight>view</span> functions, are free</dt>
        <dd>used to read data from the blockchain; no sender required</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>How Ethereum works: blocks</h2>
      <p class=callout>
      The entire history of state updates is a sequence of txns.<br>
      These are organised into <span class=highlight>blocks</span>.<br>
      The consensus mechanism selects a block (which also refers to a parent block) as the canonical head of the chain.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>access/participation via a decentralised peer-to-peer network of <span class=highlight>nodes</span></dt>
        <dd>
          each node has a view on the current machine state, agreeing at least on the latest finalised block
        </dd>
        <dt>transactions are broadcast to the network</dt>
        <dd>a <span class=highlight>validating</span> (proof of stake) node is randomly selected every slot (12 seconds) to propose a block that specifies the included transactions and their order
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>How Ethereum works: ABI</h2>
      <p class=callout>
      There are conventions for interpreting call data.<br>
      The most popular <span class=italic>application binary interface</span> (ABI) is provided by the <span class=highlight>Solidity</span> high-level smart contract programming language.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Byte encoding of typed data by convention</dt>
        <dd><span class=code>uint256</span>, <span class=code>address</span> (<span class=code>bytes20</span>), <span class=code>bool[]</span>, …<br>
          32 bytes per value of basic types, length-prefixed encoding of compound types
        </dd>
        <dt>Function selector: initial 4 bytes of call data</dt>
        <dd>
          convention: initial bytes of hash of function signature<br>
          example: <span class=code>0xa543ccea</span> for <span class=code>setWithdrawalAddress(address,address,bool)</span>

      <h2>EVMs beyond Ethereum</h2>
      <p class=callout>
      The future of Ethereum applications is on <span class=highlight>layer 2 rollups</span>.<br>
      These are blockchains that settle their state updates as data on Ethereum, typically using ZK SNARK proofs.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>The need for layer 2s is scaling</dt>
        <dd>freedom to explore strategies&mdash;e.g. less decentralised&mdash;for higher throughput</dd>
        <dt>Many layer 2s use the EVM for computation</dt>
        <dd>or at least are EVM-compatible, but some use different models entirely</dd>
        <dt>It remains to be seen what is most adopted</dt>
        <dd>however, it looks like ETH as asset and Ethereum as settlement layer has strong network effects</dd>

      <h2>What is Verifereum?</h2>
      formal verification for ethereum applications
      why this domain is good for verification: well-specified, small programs, very high value exploits that are essentially impossible to undo, immutable by default
      motivations: auditing market charges good money
      many applications have large bug bounties
      correct-by-construction application development may be worthwhile
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>How Verifereum works</h2>
      formal model of the EVM
      program logic for reasoning about applications
      decompilation of bytecode
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Verifereum: current status</h2>
      draft EVM model is mostly complete
      working on evaluation-in-logic and passing external test suites
      next steps after that would be verifying some simple contracts
