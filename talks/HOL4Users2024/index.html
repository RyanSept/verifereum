      <h2>How Ethereum works</h2>
      <p class=callout>
      Ethereum is a shared decentralised computer.<br>
      There is global <span class=highlight>consensus on the state</span> of the machine.<br>
      <span class=highlight>State updates</span> obey deterministic rules, driven by user txns.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          The state is organised into <span class=highlight>accounts</span>, containing:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <ul>
            <li>a 20 byte address</li>
            <li>an ether balance</li>
            <li>storage: a map from <span class=code>bytes32</span> to <span class=code>bytes32</span></li>
            <li>(optionally) code: a sequence of bytes</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>How Ethereum works: blocks</h2>
      state updates are an ordered sequence of transactions
      these transactions are organised into blocks
      this is for the sake of the consensus mechanism which ultimately designates certain blocks (at the head of a chain, since blocks refer to their parent) as final (i.e. canonical)
      peer-to-peer network of nodes have a view on the current machine state, but all agree on history at least till the finalised block
      transactions are broadcast. a (validating) node is randomly selected every slot to propose a block that specifies the included transactions and their order.

      <h2>What is Verifereum?</h2>
      formal verification for ethereum applications
      why this domain is good for verification: well-specified, small programs, very high value exploits that are essentially impossible to undo, immutable by default
      motivations: auditing market charges good money
      many applications have large bug bounties
      correct-by-construction application development may be worthwhile
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>How Verifereum works</h2>
      formal model of the EVM
      program logic for reasoning about applications
      decompilation of bytecode
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Verifereum: current status</h2>
      draft EVM model is mostly complete
      working on evaluation-in-logic and passing external test suites
      next steps after that would be verifying some simple contracts
